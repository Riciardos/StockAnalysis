# StockAnalysis
Small project to automate some technical analysis of stocks and indices.

End goal is to make a program that automatically downloads CSV files with index data, processes information about them and returns relevant info.
All is done in Python, with the use of Numpy packages to do the hard number crunching and Matplotlib to portray the information.
